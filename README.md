# DP-Disharmony
Python script to calculate a distance matrix between a set of design patterns (as described by a txt file). This program is intended to work with both behavioral and structural design patterns in software engineering. Distances are calculated between design patterns implemented in open source Java projects, as well as the formal definition provided in [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://books.google.com/books/about/Design_Patterns.html?id=6oHuKQe3TjQC&source=kp_cover&hl=en). 

# Status: WORK IN PROGRESS
This project is still in the begining phases. Please forgive any kinks, and we assure you we are working on them.
